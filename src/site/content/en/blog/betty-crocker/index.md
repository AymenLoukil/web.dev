## About Betty Crocker

For nearly a century, Betty Crocker has been America's source for modern cooking instruction
and trusted recipe development.
Since 1921, when (the fictive character) Betty Crocker began answering questions
about baking by letter, she's been working to teach people to cook.
Launched in 1997, [BettyCrocker.com](https://www.bettycrocker.com/)
continues the legacy of adapting, discovering and sharing the knowledge that home cooks crave.
Today, the site receives more than 12&nbsp;million visitors per month.

## The retired iOS and Android apps

Launched to [much fanfare](https://consumergoods.com/betty-crocker-launches-cookbook-app) in 2014,
Betty Crocker recently took their apps out of the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.
The technical platform the app was created on was outdated
and the business did not have the resources
to support updating and maintaining the app moving forward.

The app did have one *killer feature*, though, that its users loved:

> "Millennial cooking pro tip: the [@BettyCrocker](https://twitter.com/BettyCrocker) mobile app
  doesn't dim or lock when you're following a recipe. TRYING THIS TONIGHT!!
  […]"—[@AvaBeilke](https://twitter.com/AvaBeilke/status/996746473168670720)

> "80% of people cook with a device in the kitchen, but screen dimming and locking is a problem.
  What did [@BettyCrocker](https://twitter.com/BettyCrocker) do?
  Updated their app to NOT dim when users are in a recipe.
  That's listening to your consumer!

> Shout to [@livefront](https://twitter.com/livefront) in minneapolis
  who solved for the screen dim issues on [@BettyCrocker](https://twitter.com/BettyCrocker) app.
  It takes a village. […]"—[@aimeereker](https://twitter.com/aimeereker/status/996751679415570435)
